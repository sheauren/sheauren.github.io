overview
	what does suffer life quality more?
		It was not cancer , heart disease or diabetes.
		It's exercise system
			when you can't moving ,basically your life sucks
				ex: Lumbar disc herniation
				ex: frozen shoulder
			protect your exercise system is protect your life.
			how to protect 
				notice your detail posture
				Sensing your body's signals
				lack of knowledge, can't think medicine can do it
	course study
		understanding the underlying principle of exercise system
		an sciense portection for exercise system's suggestion
		complete your medicial knowledge's puzzle

why Orthopedic Medicine not only bone management?
	Orthopedic Medicine is exercise system management
		exercise system includes four factors: 
			bone: standy,support
			muscle: move
			ligament: reduce friction and damping
			cartilage: stabilizing
		Cask Theory:
			exercise performance is depend your four factors's minimum factor.
		head or body's bone doesn't exercise system, does not include they

system inbalance: bone disease , bone injury
	why injury or disease?
		four factors is inbalance
	consider 4 four factors's repair policy
		muscle: exceeding compensation,
			repair region less then 30%
		bone: exceeding compensation,
			bone is very strong, exceeding compensation will happen after fracture effect
		ligament: less blood, less repair rule
		cartilage: no blood, no repair rule
	long time inbalance due to chronic, it was inbalance's penalty
	some chronic was occur after long cycles : inbalnce, exceeding compensation, inbalance's loop.

restore balance - first step in Orthopedic interventions
	medicine can cure only 1% disease
	all orthopedic mediction is to restore balance, it has four methods:
		1. resection: remove injury part prevent it surfer other parts
		2. repair: suture(muscle,ligament) and reset(bone)
		3. reconstruction: remove and restore by other material
		4. regeneration: make injury part auto regeneration

spine - cervical spine to lumber spine
	upright and modern life
		long time set
			muscle tight
			intervertebral disc increase or broken when long time in high pressure
					borken will let muscle tighter ... loop
	spine naturl bug: reptile's evolute to upright
	spine = vertebra + intervertebral disc + vertebra ...
	inbalance -> compensation -> more inbalance -> more ...
	how in solve in orthopedic medicine?
		muscle fatigue
			Anti-inflammatory drugs
			rest
			massage
			hot compress
		intervertebral disc broken
			minimally invasive surgery
		spine curve
			internal fixation spine
	suggestion for health
		prevent long sitting
		add rest time bewteen sitting
		add muscle in nect and waist
			exercise 小燕飛(superman) 30 times
at upper body, why is the problem always in the joints
	the feature in upper body is flexible,it can handle more precise motion but has less stable
		when walk upright , upper body and lower body's job was change , increase flexible and decrease stable
			upper body need flexible, can 360 degree rotate:
				wrist joint 
				elbow joint
			upper body don't need heavy load,the muscle and bone weakness than lower body

	common problem in upper body:
		dislocation
			muscle or ligament has problem
			50% occurs in shoulder
		soft tissue wear and tear
			chronic sterile inflammation
	how to sloved this issue?
		reduce more damage
			rest
			prevent heavy load
			workout upper body muscle
		increase repair speed

lower body: does long distance running will injury knee?
	consider the problem : loading, it is all injury's cause
		knee joint: Meniscus damage
		ankle sprain
			when liagment damage, need doctor help
	suggestion
		reduce some easy let joint injury's activities
		add protective gear prevent injury
		increase muscle let joint stable
		are you suitable for long distance running?
		need consider your loading in knee joint and some weak joint

is daily calcium supplement useful?
	cells
		osteoblasts: create new bone, need Vitamin D , it will use calcium form blood
			notice ages:
				0~2 years old
					rapid increase period
					add Vitaman D will better
				2~11 years old
					normal mode
				12~16 (boy) , 10~15(girl)
					rapid increase period
					add calcium
				middle ages
					prevent osteoporosis
						add calcuim and Vitaman D
						less drink , coffee , smoking, High Phosphorus Drink(cola)
						exercise
		osteoclasts: destory old bone
	your heights
		upper bound depend by gene 
		lower bound depend by exercise and diet
Offense and Defense
	fracture: fixed & repair > 3 months , recovery > 1~1.5 years
		don't lay in bed, need some exercise
	Bacterial infections
		inflammation
			increase resistance
			antibiotic    
	autoimmune disease
		rheumatoid arthritis
			around joint's bone and cartilage destruction
		ankylosing spondylitis
	how to treat autoimmune disease
		no way, only relieve symptoms
Orthopedic Medicine in future 
	Bionic Medicine: repair damaged function
	Biomedical Science: cure various disease
	Regenration Science: eternal life
