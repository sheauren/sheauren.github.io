overfitting
    model
        tensor = capacity
        more tensor = memorization capacity
        compressed representations
            tensor number choose
                to much capacity
                not enough capacity
    create baseline model
        create smaller model
        create bigger model
            easy fit train data
            easy overfit
        compare training& validation loss
    stragies prevent overfit
        Weight Regularization
            L1/L2
                Dense(16)Relu,regularizer=l1(0.001) #absolute liner weight
                Dense(16)Relu,regularizer=l2(0.001) #absolute square weight
        Dropout
            Dropout(0.5)
        Reduce capacity
